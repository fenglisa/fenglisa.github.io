Methods vs. functions, `self` vs. `this`, objects vs. Objects (??), moving from server side to client side was...a process. The transition has not only made me more appreciative of Ruby's easy to read syntax and error alerting, but also of the instant dynamics a single page can offer through JavaScript. Thanks to my orientation in Ruby, object oriented JS was a lot easier to grasp. 

Connecting the Ruby backend to the JS frontend (what felt like almost two individual builds at this point in my coding journey) was a whole other beast to understand. `fetch`-ing and subsequently handling the JSON responses was a lot less intimidating when it was just a Ruby CLI application and there were fewer asynchronously moving pieces. However, because of AJAX, we get instant gratification from a JS application. 

Overall, I am excited for the results that JavaScript can produce and I look forward to using React.
