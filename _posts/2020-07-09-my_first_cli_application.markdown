##### Can I call myself a software engineer now? 
For my CLI portfolio project, I wanted to make something that I would use time after time; so I chose to make an *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* villager "finder." 

For those who are not familiar with ACNH, it's a game where you curate a deserted island into your own personalized island. A part of the curation is populating your island with villagers. ACNH has over 300 distinct villagers, however, your island can only host up to 10 of them. Once you invite a villager to live on your island, they stay for an indefinite amount of time, so it's better if you like them. That's where my ACNH Villager Finder app comes in. 


```
Welcome to ACNH Villager Finder

Here are some things you can do:
Enter villager name to see their profile
Enter personality to see villagers of that personality
Enter species to see villagers of that species
Enter 'S' to see the types of species
Enter 'P' to see the types of personalities
Enter 'A' to see all villager names in alphabetical order
Enter 'Q' to quit
```

The two main things that make a villager distinct are their species and personalities. You'll notice there are multiple ways to find a villager. If you wanted a particular species or personality, ACNH Villager Finder will list the villagers of that particular type. 

```
goat
---------------The Goat crew--------------
Chevre
Nan
Billy
Gruff
Velma
Kidd
Pashmina
Sherb
```
```
cranky
---------------The Cranky ones--------------
Cyrano
Curt
Chow
Groucho
Grizzly
Ike
Admiral
Angus
T-Bone
...
```

The finder could also help you if you wanted to see all the possible species or if you wanted a reference on the different personalities. If you had a particular villager in mind (or heard their name floating around the ACNH community) and you wanted to learn more about them, ACNH Villager Finder has a profile for each villager. 

```
fauna
---------------Profile--------------
Name: Fauna
Species: Deer
Personality: Normal
```

The ACNH community loves sharing and this CLI application utilizes the free [ACNH API](http://acnhapi.com/). 

My takeaway from this project is that building something that interests you is really what makes coding fun. As someone who had no interest in computer science in the past, I finally get the hype!
